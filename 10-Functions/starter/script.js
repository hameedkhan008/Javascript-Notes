// book(23, 'Sarah Williams'); // here the 'books function' is like a regular function and we know that the 'this keyword' in a regulagr function call is undefined at least in 'strict mode' so we will get an error here, so we have to tell the javasrcipt explicitly how exactly the 'this keyword' should work here, and we have three function to do that and they are Call(), Apply() and Bind().

// Call method 
books.call(eurowings, 23, 'Sarah Wiliams'); // so this time we did actually not call the 'book() function' ourselves instead we called the 'call() method' and then this call method will call the 'book function' with the 'this keyword' set to 'eurowings object', so whatever we pass as the first arguments in the 'call method' the this keyword starts pointing on that 'element or object or array' and then all the arguments after the first one are simply the arguments of the original function. and allows us to manually and expilcitly set the 'this keyword' of any function that we want to call.
console.log(eurowings);

// now you could argu that what we just did here could easily have been done with 'default parameters' but this is actually different because this here is creating a brand new simply more specific function based on more general function which is the 'addTax function' and ofcourse the example here could be a lot more complex too, so this really is different because using 'bind method' actually really gives us a new function, so it is as if we return a new specific function from the addTax function'.

// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} Passenger`);
  }
}

// a closure makes a function remember all the variables that existed at the function's birth Place essentially, so here we can imagin 'secureBooking function' as being the birthplace of the 'booker function' essentially , so the 'booker function' remembers everything at its birthplace by the time it was created.
// the secret of the closure is that, any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which the function was created, now in the case of 'booker' this function was created or it was born in the execution context of 'securebooking function' which was popped off the stack previously, so therefore the 'booker function' will get access to the variable environment of the  'secureBooking function' which contains 'let passengerCount = 0;' in this case, and this is how the function will be able to read and manipulate the passenger count variable and so its this connection that we call closure. 
// what maters the most here is that the 'booker function' has access to the 'passengerCount variable' because its basically defined in the scope in which the 'booker function' was actually created, so in a sense the scope chain is actually preserved through the 'closure' even when a scope has already beed destroyed because its execution context is gone , this means that even though the execution context has actually been destroyed the variable environment somehow keeps living somewhere in the engine,
// now we can say that the 'booker function' closed over its parent scope or over its parent variable environment and this includes all function arguments even though in this example don't have any, and now this attached or closed over variable environment stays with the function forever ,it will carry it arround and be able to use it forever, to make it a bit more digestible we can also say that thanks to the 'Closure' a function does not loose connection to variables that existed at the function's birthplace that's a bit more intuitive ( simple ) right?
// Let's see what happens now with execution of the 'booker function' so the function attempts to increase the  passengerCount variable, however this variable is not in the current scope and so javascript will immediately look into the 'Closure' and see if it can find variable there and it does this even before looking at the scope chain, For example if there was a 'global passengerCount variable' set to 10 it would still first use the one in the closure, so the closure basically has priority over the scope chain and so after running this function the 'passengerCount' becomes 1 this message is logged and then the execution context is popped off the stack then ececution moves to the next line we get a new execution context and closure is still there still attached to the function and the value is still 1 and so now this function executes increasing the passengerCount to 2 and logging a message again and that what's Closure are.
